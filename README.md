# How to get this tutorial _started_. Choose your adventure:

### 1. "I'm not that experienced with git and python."

Not quite sure what "clone the repo" means? Here's what to do:

0. Do you have a folder on your computer where you usually code in? Great! If not, go ahead and create a `CODE` folder on your desktop. We will be working here for this tutorial.

1. Open up a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you expect to do your coding (in this example "CODE") `cd ~/Desktop/CODE/`

2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jkbren/nerccs-2022`

3. Navigate into the repository: `cd nerccs-2022`

4. Install the software: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Start up the jupyter notebook! `jupyter notebook`

### 2. "I'm comfortable with git and python."

To install the software for this tutorial, clone the repo and run the following:

```
cd nerccs-2022
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. "I don't want to live-code this tutorial."

Follow along in the jupyter notebook [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/jkbren/nerccs-2022/blob/master/data-visualization-nerccs.ipynb)!
